<h1>Morse Code Encoder & Decoder</h1> <p><a href="https://github.com/maazsiddiqui79/Morse-Code-Encoder-Decoder" target="_blank">GitHub Repository</a> | <a href="http://morse-origin.vercel.app/" target="_blank">Live Website</a></p> <hr /> <h2><strong>Type:</strong> Web Utility</h2> <hr /> <h2>Functionality Overview</h2> <p>This application allows users to encode plain English text into Morse code and decode Morse code back into readable English. It supports both real-time encoding/decoding and batch conversions for longer text inputs. It can be used for educational purposes, historical communication practices, or fun experimentation with encoding systems.</p> <h2>User Interface</h2> <ul> <li>Minimalist and distraction-free design with central alignment.</li> <li>Responsive layout optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop use.</li> <li>Clear input/output separation with intuitive conversion buttons.</li> </ul> <h2>Features</h2> <ul> <li><strong>Encode:</strong> Converts alphanumeric characters and selected punctuation into Morse code.</li> <li><strong>Decode:</strong> Parses Morse code (using spaces and slashes) into plain English text.</li> <li><strong>Validation:</strong> Automatically detects invalid characters or malformed Morse syntax and prompts the user with a warning.</li> <li><strong>Case-insensitive:</strong> Accepts both uppercase and lowercase letters.</li> <li><strong>Real-time preview:</strong> Optional toggle to see live encoding/decoding as you type.</li> </ul> <h2>Supported Characters</h2> <p>The application currently supports:</p> <ul> <li>Alphabets: A–Z</li> <li>Numbers: 0–9</li> <li>Punctuation: Period (.), Comma (,), Question Mark (?), Apostrophe (’), Slash (/), and more</li> <li>Spacing: Single space between letters, slash (/) between words in Morse</li> </ul> <h2>Example Long Paragraph</h2> <p>Morse code, originally developed for telegraphic communication, has stood the test of time due to its efficiency and clarity in signal-based transmission. This application revives its practical utility in a modern web-based environment. Whether you're a student learning about cryptography, a ham radio enthusiast practicing signal sequences, or simply intrigued by encoded languages, this tool offers a clean, educational, and interactive experience. Users can test short phrases or encode paragraphs into Morse code, gaining insights into how message compression and symbol translation work in practice.</p> <p>Furthermore, the dual-mode interface allows bidirectional conversion with an emphasis on clarity and accuracy. Built with robust logic and designed for maximum user engagement, the Morse Code Encoder & Decoder is a bridge between historical communication and modern learning platforms.</p> <h2>Technology Stack</h2> <ul> <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla)</li> <li><strong>Backend:</strong> Flask (for advanced hosted version with logging capabilities)</li> <li><strong>Hosting:</strong> Render (Live deployment)</li> </ul> <h2>Security Notice</h2> <p>This utility does not require authentication and does not store user data. No tracking or cookies are used. A separate admin module is in development for log auditing in the Flask-based variant.</p> <hr />
