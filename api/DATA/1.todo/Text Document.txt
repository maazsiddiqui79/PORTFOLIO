<h1>To-Do List Manager</h1> <p><a href="https://github.com/maazsiddiqui79/To-Do-App-with-User-Authentication" target="_blank">GitHub Repository</a> | <a href="https://go-todo-task.onrender.com/" target="_blank">Live Website</a></p> <hr /> <h2><strong>Type:</strong>Web</h2> <hr /> <h2>User Authentication (Hashed Passwords)</h2> <p>All users are required to create an account with a unique username and a strong password. Passwords are hashed using SHA-256 with a salt to ensure enhanced security and stored in an encrypted format. Upon login, the hash of the entered password is compared to the stored hash for verification.</p> <p>The application supports multiple user roles, allowing different access levels such as:</p> <ul> <li>Admin &ndash; Can manage all To-Do items and user accounts.</li> <li>Standard User &ndash; Can create, update, and delete their own To-Do items.</li> <li>Read-Only &ndash; Can only view To-Do lists.</li> </ul> <h2>Create a New To-Do</h2> <p>To create a new To-Do task, click on the &quot;New Task&quot; button. Enter the task description, set the priority (High, Medium, Low), and select the due date. You can add a very long detailed description using the rich text editor.</p> <h2>Example Long Paragraph</h2> <p>This is an example of a very long paragraph to simulate content as found on Wikipedia. The To-Do List application is more than a simple task tracker; it is a productivity hub where tasks are centralized, priorities are visualized, and deadlines are met with precision. With support for multiple formatting options like bold, italics, headings, lists, links, and embedded media, the CKEditor-based input provides unparalleled flexibility to the end user. Users can document not only what to do, but also why, how, and with what dependencies or historical references a task has been created. This documentation-style note-taking blends task management with knowledge management&mdash;much like Wikipedia articles are structured around clarity, hierarchy, and readability.</p> <p>Whether you&#39;re organizing a collaborative team sprint, planning long-term academic goals, or structuring your business objectives, this To-Do platform ensures your workflow remains efficient and trackable. It is especially helpful for educational, editorial, and software development use cases where context-rich task notes are essential.</p> <h2>Update / Edit Tasks</h2> <p>Click the &quot;Edit&quot; icon next to any task. The rich-text editor will allow you to modify the task description, change the priority level, and update the completion deadline. You can also attach long explanatory content or even collaborative notes.</p> <h2>Delete Tasks</h2> <p>Use the &quot;Delete&quot; button to remove any task from your list. Deleted tasks are archived and can be restored within 30 days unless permanently deleted by the user or an admin.</p> <h2>Priority Levels</h2> <ul> <li><strong>High:</strong> Must be completed today or within the next 24 hours.</li> <li><strong>Medium:</strong> Important but not urgent. Usually within 3-5 days.</li> <li><strong>Low:</strong> Can be done anytime. No immediate impact.</li> </ul> <h2>Benefits of Using This Platform</h2> <ul> <li>Data-centered layout with distraction-free environment like Wikipedia.</li> <li>Rich-text support using CKEditor for expressive and detailed notes.</li> <li>Secure user access with hashed passwords and multi-role support.</li> <li>Priority-based visual tagging of tasks (color-coded).</li> <li>Mobile responsive and desktop-optimized with central alignment.</li> </ul> <h2>Security Notice</h2> <p>All passwords are hashed using SHA-256 or bcrypt (depending on the environment) and never stored in plain text. User sessions are managed securely via HTTP-only cookies and CSRF protection is enabled to prevent unauthorized actions.</p> <hr />
