It supports user authentication with hashed passwords, tracks usage data, and allows custom aliases for each shortened link.</p> <h2>User Authentication (Hashed Passwords)</h2> <p>Users must register with a unique username and secure password. Passwords are hashed using SHA-256 or bcrypt to ensure strong security. Authentication is required to create, manage, or delete shortened links.</p> <h2>Create a Short Link</h2> <p>After logging in, enter a long URL and optionally specify a custom alias. The app will generate a unique, compact link that redirects to the original URL. Expiry dates and link titles can also be set for better management.</p> <h2>Example Use Case</h2> <p>This tool is perfect for simplifying long tracking URLs, making affiliate or marketing links more readable, and sharing links on platforms with character limits like Twitter. It also helps in managing private or limited-time access to content by using expiration controls.</p> <h2>Track and Manage Links</h2> <p>View a list of all your shortened URLs along with access count, creation date, and expiration status. You can delete links or modify custom aliases and expiration settings if needed.</p> <h2>Security Measures</h2> <ul> <li>Passwords are never stored in plain text; they&#39;re hashed with salt.</li> <li>User sessions use HTTP-only cookies for protection.</li> <li>CSRF tokens protect all form submissions.</li> </ul> <h2>Key Features</h2> <ul> <li>Custom short aliases</li> <li>Hashed password-based login system</li> <li>Click tracking and analytics</li> <li>Optional link expiration</li> <li>Mobile-responsive UI with a clean layout</li> </ul> <hr />
